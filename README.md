# Chatbot Project

## Project Rules & Guidelines

- Use **Python 3.x** for all development.
- Use **Django** as the primary web framework.
- Use **SQLite** as the default development database.
- Follow **PEP8** for Python code style.
- Store secrets and API keys in the `.env` file (never commit `.env` to git).
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Keep documentation up to date in this `README.md` or in a `docs/` folder if needed.

### Additional Best Practices

- Use virtual environments for Python dependencies (`venv` or `virtualenv`).
- Pin dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file and update it regularly.
- Document all functions and classes with clear docstrings.
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the “why” as well as the “what.”
- Review code before merging (if collaborating, use pull requests).
- Keep code modular and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
- Handle errors gracefully and log exceptions where appropriate.
- Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration (never hard-code secrets).
- Back up your database before making major changes to models or migrations.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Write and maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking major changes and releases.
- Follow semantic versioning for releases (if distributing or collaborating).
- Add type hints to Python code for better readability and tooling support.
- Automate testing and linting (consider using tools like `pytest`, `flake8`, or `black`).
- Respect user privacy and data security in all code and documentation.
